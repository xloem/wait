  <h3>Why Am I Talking: In Pursuit of Radio Silence</h3>

  <p>Radio hacking is real.  You can buy a $20 tv-tuner and use open source
  software to tune into your neighbor's display and see what they're doing
  without even knowing where they are, by reconstructing it from signal leakage
  patterns that repeat at the refresh rate.  These wide technologies are not
  common because people like having power.  We need to understand these things
  better, and have the freedom to protect against them, because some are using
  them to control the lives of others.</p>

  <h4>Step 1: Security</h4>

  <p>This same $20 dongle is great for measuring the shielding effectiveness of
  readily-available items.  This is where I begin.</p>

  <h4>Needed:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Attenuation and shielding information from a peer-reviewed journal.</li>
  <li>Credible information on organized stalking, radio hacking, targetting of individuals, post-9/11 gang/homeland security behavior, even biohacking and mind control.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Data Format for Raw RTL-SDR Dumps</h5>
  <ul>
  <li> First four bytes: uint32_t size of device structure </li>
  <li> A stream of one of the following: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> 1 byte LOG_DATA=00: A block of I/Q data received from the device.  4 bytes uint32_t data length, and then that many bytes of data.  1 byte I, 1 byte Q, repeat.  Data is 0-255 unsigned, centered around 127.</li>
    <li> 1 byte LOG_TIME=01: The current time from epoch follows as a struct timespec.  This will be 4 bytes seconds, then 4 bytes nanoseconds.</li>
    <li> 1 byte LOG_STRUCT=02: A change in device state.  The current device state follows as a struct rtlsdr_dev.  This is also a rtlsdr_dev_t which can be passed into the librtlsdr c functions and queried.  The length of this data is the first 4 bytes in the file.  I think the current tuned frequency is in MHz as a 4 byte unsigned value 128 bytes into the structure.</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
