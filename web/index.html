  <h4>Why Am I Talking: In Pursuit of Radio Silence</h4>

  <p>Radio hacking is real.  You can buy a $20 tv-tuner and use open source
  software to tune into your neighbor's display and see what they're doing
  without even knowing where they are, by reconstructing it from signal leakage
  patterns that repeat at the refresh rate.  These wide technologies are not
  common because people like having power.  We need to understand these things
  better, and have the freedom to protect against them, because some are using
  them to control the lives of others.</p>

  <h5>Step 1: Security</h5>

  <p>This same $20 dongle is great for measuring the shielding effectiveness of
  readily-available items.  This is where I begin.</p>
