  <h3>Why Am I Talking: In Pursuit of Radio Silence</h3>

  <p>Radio hacking is real.  You can buy a $20 tv-tuner and use open source
  software to tune into your neighbor's display and see what they're doing
  without even knowing where they are, by reconstructing it from signal leakage
  patterns that repeat at the refresh rate.  These wide technologies are not
  common because people like having power.  We need to understand these things
  better, and have the freedom to protect against them, because some are using
  them to control the lives of others.</p>

  <h4>Step 1: Security</h4>

  <p>This same $20 dongle is great for measuring the shielding effectiveness of
  readily-available items.  This is where I begin.</p>

  <h4>Needed:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Attenuation and shielding information from a peer-reviewed journal.</li>
  <li>Credible information on organized stalking, radio hacking, targetting of individuals, post-9/11 gang/homeland security behavior, even biohacking and mind control.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Patent US4871883 mentions high-quality shielding braided around cables in 3 layers with the middle layer polycrystalline such as mu-metal or metallic glass used in high-noise-sensitivity applications.  Separating the layers with insulation may provide greater shielding.  Ferrite (iron) dust is often mixed with plastic or some compound for one layer.</p>
  <p>Patent US5045637 describes a 2cm layer of iron entirely enclosing a space as giving 13 dB attenuation from 100 gauss, and describes a much lighter method involving layering two different materials, one with high magnetic permeability and one with magnetic high flux density.</p>
  <p>Introduction to Magnetic Materials, B. D. Cullity, Chap 2.8: High magnetic permeability sheets such as Nickel-Iron alloy are used for magnetic shielding in electronics.  These materials absorb field in faces perpendicular to the field direction -- concentric cylinders work better than thick ones.</p>
